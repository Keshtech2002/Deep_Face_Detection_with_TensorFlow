## Steps Embarked in this project

1. Annotate
    - This is used to draw a box around the face or object to remove other things in the background ```Boundary box Annotation```
    - For this a library called ```LABELME```
    - ```LABELME``` allows you to do more than boundary box annotation
    - It allows Key point annotation, segmentation and others
    `labelme` is an open-source graphical image annotation tool. It allows users to draw bounding boxes, polygons, and other shapes to annotate objects in images. This tool is commonly used in computer vision
    projects for creating labeled datasets for training machine learning models.

        To use `labelme`, follow these general steps:

        1. **Installation:**
           You can install `labelme` using `pip`:

           ```
           bash
           pip install labelme
           ```

        2. **Annotation:**
           - Open `labelme` by running the following command in the terminal:

             ```
             bash
             labelme
             ```

           - Use the graphical interface to open an image and start annotating. Draw bounding boxes or polygons around objects in the image.

           - Save the annotations in the JSON format. `labelme` saves both the image and annotation information in a JSON file.

        3. **Data Format:**
           The annotations are saved in a JSON file, and the structure looks like this:

           ```json
           {
               "version": "4.5.6",
               "flags": {},
               "shapes": [
                   {
                       "label": "object_class",
                       "points": [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...],
                       "group_id": null,
                       "shape_type": "rectangle",
                       "flags": {},
                   },
                   // ... other shapes
               ],
               "imagePath": "path/to/image.jpg",
               "imageData": "base64-encoded-image-data",
               "imageHeight": 480,
               "imageWidth": 640
           }
           ```

        4. **Integration with ML Projects:**
           - Once you have annotated your images and saved the corresponding JSON files, you can use the labeled dataset to train your machine learning models.

           - Many machine learning frameworks, like TensorFlow or PyTorch, have tools to handle datasets in the format generated by `labelme`.

        Remember to consult the `labelme` documentation for more detailed instructions and tips on using the tool.

2. The Albumentations library is a popular open-source Python library for image augmentation. It is specifically designed for machine learning and computer vision tasks, providing a variety of image
    transformations to enhance the diversity and size of training datasets. Image augmentation is a common technique used to improve the generalization and robustness of machine learning models, especially in
    tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation.

    Key features of the Albumentations library include:

        1. **Rich Set of Transformations:** Albumentations offers a wide range of image transformations such as rotations, flips, zooming, scaling, brightness adjustments, contrast adjustments, and more.

        2. **Efficiency:** The library is known for its high-speed image processing, making it efficient for large datasets and real-time augmentation during training.

        3. **Compatibility:** Albumentations is compatible with popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, making it easy to integrate into existing workflows.

        4. **Customization:** Users can easily combine multiple transformations and customize their parameters to create diverse and realistic augmented images.

        5. **Support for Various Data Types:** Apart from image data, Albumentations supports augmentation for other data types such as masks, keypoints, and bounding boxes.

    Here's a simple example of how Albumentations can be used in Python:

        ```
        python
        import albumentations as A
        from albumentations.pytorch import ToTensorV2
        from PIL import Image

        # Define a list of augmentation transforms
        transform = A.Compose([
            A.RandomRotate90(),
            A.Flip(),
            A.Transpose(),
            A.ShiftScaleRotate(shift_limit=0.1, scale_limit=0.1, rotate_limit=15, p=0.5),
            A.Normalize(),
            ToTensorV2(),
        ])

        # Load an image
        image = Image.open('path/to/your/image.jpg')

        # Apply augmentation
        augmented_image = transform(image=np.array(image))['image']

        # Display original and augmented images
        image.show(title='Original Image')
        Image.fromarray(augmented_image).show(title='Augmented Image')
        ```

    Make sure to install the library using:

        ```
        bash
        pip install albumentations
        ```

    It's a powerful tool for enhancing the performance of your machine learning models, particularly in scenarios where having a diverse and extensive dataset is crucial.
